# school-district-analysis

## OVERVIEW

In this analysis, the standardized test scores for 15 schools within a school district were used to provide insights on performance trends and patterns. The main objective was to assist the school district with decisions regarding budget allotments and priorities.

It was later learned that the standardized test scores for ninth grade students at Thomas High School (THS) may be compromised, and after review, it was decided that the original analysis should be refactored to exclude the test scores for this group. 

In doing so, 461 students records were precluded from the final analysis, which was presented to the board.
